# RL Game: AI-Powered Game Environment

This project is a **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Deep Q-Learning (DQL)** based game environment where a player must evade enemies. It features a graphical interface built with **Pygame** and includes an AI agent powered by **Keras** and **NumPy**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features:
- **Deep Q-Learning:** AI agent learns optimal strategies through trial and error
- **Pygame-based visualization:** Real-time simulation of AI behavior
- **Dynamic enemies:** Constantly changing environment for training
- **Modular design:** Easily integrate other RL algorithms

## ðŸš€ Installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git  
cd repository  
pip install -r requirements.txt  
python main.py
